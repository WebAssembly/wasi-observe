## Minutes

- [**@brooksmtownsend**][bt]: I like mapping it to OTel
- [**@brooksmtownsend**][bt]: Addresses a few comments from the PR
- [**@brooksmtownsend**][bt]: Doesn't want to bikeshed names but maybe this should be called otel
- [**@brooksmtownsend**][bt]: I think a mechanism to start a span as a new root is good
- [**@brooksmtownsend**][bt]: I think the resource thing is a good idea
- [**@brooksmtownsend**][bt]: Might make sense for start to return a result in the case where tracing is turned off
- [**@calebschoepp**][cs]: I feel like if tracing is off they could all just be no-ops
- [**@brooksmtownsend**][bt]: Suggest we add a get current context function
- [**@calebschoepp**][cs]: We used to have functionality for that
- [**@calebschoepp**][cs]: One weird thing was that making span context's could fail and I didn't know where to bubble up that failure
- [**@brooksmtownsend**][bt]: Implementing guest libraries will tell us a lot about how we should do that
- [**@brooksmtownsend**][bt]: It could be useful to have a notion of a trace resource
- [**@calebschoepp**][cs]: I have concerns around making a trace resource
- [**@brooksmtownsend**][bt]: My main goal is that I want guest applications to be able to use otel libraries
- [**@calebschoepp**][cs]: We should probably call this wasi:otel or ba:otel
- [**@brooksmtownsend**][bt]: I think that it might actually belong in wasi
- [**@brooksmtownsend**][bt]: I think that makes a lot of sense to call this wasi:otel and put trace, metric, and logging interfaces under it
- [**@calebschoepp**][cs]: I care more about just traces and logs
- [**@brooksmtownsend**][bt]: wasi logging is a fundamental thing

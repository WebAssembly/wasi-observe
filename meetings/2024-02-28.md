## Minutes

- [CD]: Welcome new members!
- [CD]: Roundtable updates
    - [Danielle]: tracing [WIT draft PR](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-observe/pull/12/files)
        - added readback (resources) and flushing (records)
        - [JC]: [cd: tktk please correct me] discussion of whether or not we want readback
        - [Danielle]: [cd tktk]
        - [JC]: Propose moving to issue
        - [JC]: set-attribute has a lot of options in otel; strings, booleans, ints, we should think about whether we want to support the full set (or a useful subset)
        - [Danielle]: any way to express this in WIT?
            - [Luke]: brute-force via multiple methods
        - [JC]: support for submitting an event with a timestamp, vs using the host
            - [Danielle]: host is your tracing provider, the equiv of your otel provider, which manages timestamps for you
            - [JC]: thinking of cases where clients provide you back server time
        - [CD]: gesturing at the goal of being a pipe
            - [Danielle]: I think most people will use the read-only spans for these purposes
        - [CD]: discussion of using the span record to support node-style "oops this span belongs to a different continuation" situations
        - [JC]: started working in php a long time ago, supported all frameworks for a long time; but then react-php came out. assumption was that we could access the span because it would be thread-local; when we attempted to instrument, we needed to pass a context
            - we explored two things: a context object; passing that as the first arg so you could access the span from the context
            - another model: you only store the id
            - if you don't have readback, you only need the id – all of the attrs are setters
            - you don't need to keep the state, you just keep the id – host holds the state by id

### Action items
